The most successful companies today are the ones who know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs beforehand. This can better be achieved if we segment the customers into different groups that reflect the similarities among the customers in each group. The goal of the segmentation is to foresee the needs of customers, get to know their interests, lifestyles, and priorities, and learn their spending habits so that to maximize the value of customers to the business.
